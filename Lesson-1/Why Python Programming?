Developer: "Guido Van Rossum" <br />
The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. <br />
Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming languages. <br />
Why is Python is so popular? There are 10 main reasons for the same: <br />
1. Easy to Learn and Use <br />
2. Mature and Supportive Python Community (I'm also one of them :P) <br />
3. Support from Reknowned Corporate Sponsors (Google adopted Python in 2006) <br />
4. Hundreds of Python Libraries and Frameworks <br />
5. Versatility, Efficiency, Reliability, and Speed <br />
6. Big Data, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing <br />
7. First-Choice Language <br />
8. The Flexibility of Python Language <br />
9. Use of Python in Academics <br />
10. Automation <br />
