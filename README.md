# Python_Language_Practice
I'm practicing Python once again from the Basics. 
The idea is to set and derive a path towards the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Irtificial Intelligence.
For the fields mentioned above the programming language which is a must needed is Python so me and my team had decided to go with that from basics and scratch.
The learning path for us is as follows:
1: Python ( from basic and scratch )
2: R ( for statistics)
3: Machine Learning Algorithm study ( theory and algorithm graphs )
4: Machine Learning Practice
5: Tensorflow Framework
6: Deep Learning with Tensorflow
7: Artificial Intelligence Study ( mostly theory )
