# Python_Language_Practice
I'm practicing Python once again from the Basics. <br />
The idea is to set and derive a path towards the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Irtificial Intelligence. <br />
For the fields mentioned above the programming language which is a must needed is Python so me and my team had decided to go with that from basics and scratch. <br />
The learning path for us is as follows: <br />
1: Python ( from basic and scratch ) <br />
2: R ( for statistics) <br />
3: Machine Learning Algorithm study ( theory and algorithm graphs ) <br />
4: Machine Learning Practice <br />
5: Tensorflow Framework <br />
6: Deep Learning with Tensorflow <br /> 
7: Artificial Intelligence Study ( mostly theory ) <br />
